I am a dedicated and highly motivated graduate student with a master's degree in Mathematics from Chongqing University (https://sci.cqu.edu.cn/), advised by Dr. Yonglu Shu, co-advised by Dr. Dong Li, and Dr. Chuanjiang He. Prior to Chongqing University, I received my B.S. in Mathematics from Jiangsu Normal University of China.

You can find my CV here:

My research interests lie in image processing algorithms and their applications to various computer vision tasks, with a focus on:

Medical Image Analysis and Processing

Computing Methodologies

Machine learning

I am seeking doctoral positions starting Fall 2026. Feel free to reach out via email (zwq@stu.cqu.edu.cn) if there are opportunities aligned with my expertise.
