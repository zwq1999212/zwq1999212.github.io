I am a dedicated and highly motivated graduate student with a master's degree in Computational Mathematics from Chongqing University(https://sci.cqu.edu.cn/), where I worked closely with Prof. shu. Prior to Chongqing University, I received my B.S. in Science in Mathematics from Jiangsu Normal University of China.

You can find my CV here: 
<a href="https://zwq1999212.github.io/assets/CV_Wenqi Zhao.pdf" target="_blank">open CV_Wenqi Zhao.pdf</a>

My research interests lie in image segmentation algorithms and their applications to various computer vision tasks, with a focus on:

Medical image segmentation models
Large language models
Machine learning
I am seeking doctoral positions starting Fall 2026. Feel free to reach out via email (zwq@stu.cqu.edu.cn) if there are opportunities aligned with my expertise.
