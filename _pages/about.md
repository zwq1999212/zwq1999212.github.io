I am a dedicated and highly motivated graduate student with a master's degree in Mathematics from Chongqing University (https://sci.cqu.edu.cn/), advised by Dr. Yonglu Shu, co-advised by Dr. Dong Li, and Dr. Chuanjiang He. Prior to Chongqing University, I received my B.S. in Mathematics from Jiangsu Normal University of China.

You can find my CV here: 
<a href="https://zwq1999212.github.io/assets/CV_Wenqi Zhao2.pdf" target="_blank">open CV_Wenqi Zhao.pdf</a>

My work spans algorithm design and applied mathematics for computational imaging and computer vision, including but not limited to:

Medical Image Analysis

Computing Methodologies

Machine learning

I am seeking doctoral positions starting Fall 2026. Feel free to reach out via email (zwq@stu.cqu.edu.cn) if there are opportunities aligned with my expertise.
